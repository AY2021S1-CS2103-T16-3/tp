* ResiReg is a project built for the CS2103 module at NUS. ResiReg is a housing management application for residential administration staff, such as admin working at NUS Residential Colleges. <br>
  Example usages:
  * to manage records of students and rooms
  * to allocate and deallocate students to rooms 
  * to generate bills and record payments
  * to manage students serving SHN notice
  * to generate reports for half-yearly audits of the admin staff
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_), originally used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `ResiReg` because it provides functionality for "__Res__idential __Reg__ulation" of dorms at a university. 
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ResiReg Product Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103-t16-3.github.io/tp)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.

## Introduction

**ResiReg** is a productivity app designed to help OHS* admin at Residential Colleges (RCs)* in NUS with their daily tasks. **ResiReg** allows admin to allocate rooms to students, and manage student and room records, generate billing and OHS reports, and export CSVs for easy reference and sharing.

**ResiReg** has the following main features:

1. Manage records of students.
2. Manage records of rooms.
3. Manage allocations of students to rooms in the College.

## Purpose and Audience for this Guide

This Developer Guide specifies the architecture, design, implementation and use cases for **ResiReg**, as well as our considerations behind key design decisions.

It is intended for developers, software testers, open-source contrubitors and any like-minded persons who wish to contribute this project or gain deeper insights about **ResiReg**.

## Setting Up

Refer to the guide [here](./SettingUp.md).

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ResiRegParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
- stores the residence regulation data.
- exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ResiReg`, which `Person` references. This allows `ResiReg` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

- can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
- can save the residence regulation data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.resireg.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Bin Feature

#### Implementation

ResiReg allows for a bin feature, where students and rooms are moved to a bin on deletion, and persist there for a user-specified period (with a default of 30 days) before they are removed permanently. The feature is built using the `BinItem`, `UniqueBinItemList` and `JsonAdaptedBinItem` classes and an interface `Binnable`. Items that can be stored in the bin (`Student` and `Room`) implement the empty<sup>1</sup> interface `Binnable`. A `BinItem` object is created when a `Binnable` object is deleted, and it contains the Binnable object and the date of deletion (implemented as a `LocalDate`) as its attributes. Consequently, the `BinItem` is placed into `UniqueBinItemList`.

The class diagram below represents the class structure pictorially.

![image](images/BinClassDiagram.png)

The following is a run-through of a typical user session where ResiReg is started, a student is deleted and moved to the bin, and then the user restores the student from the bin. Note that the sequence is the same for when a room is deleted and restored.

Step 1. On launching ResiReg, `ModelManager` calls `ModelManager#deleteExpiredItems()` during initialization. This method iterates through `UniqueBinItemList` and removes all bin items which have expired (i.e they have persisted in the bin for more days than the user-specified cutoff) by calling `UniqueBinItemList#remove()` for the expired object.

Step 2. The user executes the `delete 1` command to delete the first student in ResiReg. The `delete`
command calls the constructor of `BinItem` with the deleted student to create a new `BinItem` object. The `dateDeleted` attribute is initialized with the current system time. 

Step 3. The `delete` command then adds the new `BinItem` object to the `UniqueBinItemList` by first checking for uniqueness (as a defensive precaution) and calling `Model#addBinItem(studentToBin)`.

The sequence diagram given below represents this process of deleting a student (steps 2 and 3).

![image](images/BinDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 4. The user executes a few other commands. He then cognizes that he has erroneously deleted the student, and doesn't wish to execute the `undo` command multiple times. He then navigates to the Bin tab, (by executing `bin`) and executes the `restore` command to retrieve the `Student` item from the bin. 

Step 5. The `execute` method of `RestoreCommand` removes the `itemToRestore` from `UniqueBinItemList` by caling `Model#deleteBinItem(itemToRestore)`. The student item is retrieved by calling an instance method, `itemToRestore.getBinnedItem()` and typecasted to a `Student` object. 

Step 6. The Ui is updated accordingly, since both the `UniqueBinItemList` and `UniqueStudentList` follow the Observer pattern. 

The following sequence diagram shows how a restore command operates.

![image](images/BinRestoreSequenceDiagram.png)

<sup>1</sup> Refer below for the design decision of maintaining an empty interface. 

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: Handling the storage of bin items
Problem Statement: A bin item must be polymorphic in its storage, i.e., it must be capable of serializing and deserializing multiple types of data (`Student`s as well as `Room`s). However, JSON does not support polymorphic storage natively, and a concrete serializable type must be provided during read/write operations. This leads to the problem of how to store `Binnable` instances whose concrete type is not known.

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reusing storage classes for `Room` and `Student` and typecasting explicitly

  - Pros: Allows a clean separation of concerns since the `Binnable` interface does not need to contain information about storage.  This removes  the need to repeat code by creating storage classes such as `JsonAdaptedStudentBin` and `JsonAdaptedRoomBin` dedicated to storing objects in the Bin only. In other words, it makes the Ui, Logic and Model structure OOP-compliant. Further, it results in more efficient testing (since storage tests for `Student` and `Room` objects need not be re-written)
  - Cons: Doesn't scale well since if new types of `Binnable` objects are to be handled by the system (e.g. `Bills`), then multiple storage-related files will have to be modified to allow for the new object to have robust type-checking and storage. In other words, it makes the storage less OOP-compliant. 

- **Alternative 2:** Assigning storage responsibility to the `Binnable` interface
  - Pros: Makes storage more OOP-compliant, prevents need for explicit type-checking. 
  - Cons: Complicates the general MVC structure, and makes it more difficult to migrate to non-JSON storage, since instances of `Binnable` (e.g. `Student` and `Room`) must now contain their storage implementation details as well. 

### Allocation/ deallocation/ reallocation feature

The allocation/ deallocation/ reallocation feature is facilitated by `Allocation`. It is an association class of the
unique identifiers of a `Student` and a `Room` to which the `Student` is allocated to. The `Allocation` association
class includes the `Student`'s `StudentId` and the allocated `Room`'s `Floor` and `RoomNumber`.

#### Implementation

When a `Student` is allocated a `Room` using `AllocateCommand`, an `Allocation` instance is created and added to the
`UniqueAllocationList`. Likewise, when a `Student` is deallocated or reallocated a different `Room` using `DeallocateCommand` and
`ReallocateCommand` respectively, the `Allocation` relating to the `Student` is removed from `ResiReg` in the former
and edited in the latter.

#### Design consideration:

Aspect: How to associate the allocation between a student and a room

- **Alternative 1:** A student has a room.

  - Pros: Trivial implementation.
  - Cons: Storage redundancy as a student now has a copy of a room.

- **Alternative 2:** A room has a student.

  - Pros: Trivial implementation.
  - Cons: Storage redundancy as a room now has a copy of a student.

- **Alternative 3:** A student has a room and a room has a student.

  - Pros: Easy implementation.
  - Cons: Cyclic dependency between a room and a student.

- **Alternative 4 (final choice):** A student's room allocation is referred to by an association class.

  - Pros: Natural representation of the allocation.
  - Cons: Require more overhead code.

Having attempted a `Student` having a `Room` attribute and/or vice versa, it inevitably ends
up with a cyclic dependency in various parts of the code, such as the `Student` or `Room`'s `toString()` methods or
their `JsonAdapted` variants, which is undesired. Therefore, the room allocation functionality was refactored into
the `Allocation` association class (alternative 4).

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `StatefulResiReg`. It extends `ResiReg` with an undo/redo history, for commands that
modify the state of ResiReg, which comprises of: students, rooms, allocations, semesters and bin items.
The history is stored internally as `redoStatesStack`, `undoStatesStack` and `currState`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `VersionedResiReg#save()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current residence regulation state in its history.
- `VersionedResiReg#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous residence regulation state from its history.
- `VersionedResiReg#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone residence regulation state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveStateResiReg()`, `Model#undoResiReg()` and `Model#redoResiReg()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedResiReg` will be initialized with the initial residence regulation state.
Both `redoStatesStack` and `undoStatesStack` will be empty, while `currState` will be set to this single residence regulation state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 3` command to delete the 3rd person in the residence regulation. The `delete` command calls `Model#saveStateResiReg()`, causing the current state of the residence regulation before the `delete 3` command executes
to be saved in the `undoStatesStack` and setting `currState` to be the state of the resident regulation after command execution.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Jet â€¦â€‹` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#saveStateResiReg()`, causing the
current unmodified state to be saved in the `undoStatesStack` and `currState` to be set to the modified resident regulation state.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveStateResiReg()`, so 
both `currState` and `undoStatesStack` will not be updated.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoResiReg()`,
which will add the current state `stateAfterAdd` to `redoStatesStack` and set `currState` to the last entry in
`undoStatesStack`, the previous residence regulation state (`stateBeforeAdd`), and restores the residence regulation to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `redoStatesStack` is empty, then there are no previous ResiReg states to restore. 
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoResiReg()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoResiReg()`, which adds the current state to `undoStatesStack` and set `currState` to the last entry in
`redoStatesStack`, the next residence regulation state, and restores the residence regulation to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If `redoStatesStack` is empty, then there are no undone ResiReg states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoResiReg()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `rooms`. Commands that do not modify the state of ResiReg
(e.g. `alias`, `rooms`, `togglesplit`, etc.) will not call `Model#saveStateResiReg()`, `Model#undoResiReg()` or `Model#redoResiReg()`. Thus, both `redoStatesStack` and `undoStatesStack` remain unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#saveStateResiReg()`.
As before, the current state `stateBeforeClear` clear will be pushed into `undoStatesStack`. This time `redoStatesStack` is no longer empty. It will be cleared as it no longer make sense to redo the add n/Jet command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![SaveActivityDiagram](images/SaveActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:
##### How undo & redo executes

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire ResiReg.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

##### Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stacks for undo and redo, along with
  a reference to current state.

  - Pros: Closer to the command pattern than the alternative below, meaning a change from Alternative 1
    to Alternative 2 in how undo & redo executes will incur less additional work.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage due to holding an additional reference and
    managing two data structures.

- **Alternative 2:** Use a list to store the history.
  - Pros: Better performance in terms of memory usage as compared to Alternative 1 and
    has a simpler implementation.
  - Cons: Further away from the command pattern than Alternative 1, so shifting to Alternative 2
    in how undo & redo executes will incur more additional work.
